###########################################         MAIN        ################################################
this file py has the purpose to use all methods need to obtain the followings scopes:
  - make a preprocessign to dataset provided for training and set: binary and multi-class classification problems,
  - create the models based on different kind of algorithms: they can be instantiated by different
    sub-class provided by the class Model implemented. The models can be chosen in order to test 
    for both classification problems provided, i.e binary and multi-class 
  - split the features and targets in order to obtain a balance input and output for training of mode,
  - perform the training of model chosen,
  - save the models,
  - perform a prediction and save it in a file in format csv,
  - evaluate the prediction with the test set provided (blind):
      - compute and plot the confusion matrix,
      - print the report of classification,
      - compute and print the accuracy of models,

Preprocessing:
In this section the preprocessing is performed:
- obtain the features with two kind of preprocessing adopted: unigrams and bigrams with occurence,
- the models are instanced with different kind of algorithm availabled in class 'Model'
'''
Preprocessing_data = preprocessing.Preprocessing()                 #instance of preprocessing data
Preprocessing_prediction = preprocessing.PreprocessingPrediction() #instance of preprocessing for prediciton phase

kind_preprocessing_unigrams = Preprocessing_data.unigrams #kind of preprocessing unigrams
kind_preprocessing_bigrams = Preprocessing_data.bigrams   #kind of preprocessing bigrams
kind_label_opt = Preprocessing_data.opt                   #kind of label used for binary class: opt
kind_label_compiler = Preprocessing_data.compiler         #kind of label used for multi-class class: compiler

'''
The choice of Algorithm:
In oder to use the algorithm in main is need to instance the desidered algorithm 
from the following list:
- Naive Bayes Multinomial algorithm => NaiveBayesMultinomial() 
- Naive Bayes Bernoulli algorithm => NaiveBayesMBernoulli()
- SVC algorithm with 'rbf' as kernel => RbfSVC()
- SVC algorithm with 'Linear' as kernel => LinearSVC()
- Decision Tree algorithm => DecisionTree()
'''

'''
The choice of Preprocessing:
create the features for training:
  - In order to choose the preprocessing is need to put in the parameter 'kind_preprocessing',
    'kind_preprocessing_unigram' if want to use unigrams preprocessing and  'kind_preprocessing_bigrams'
    if want to use bigrams preprocessing with occurrences (CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))),
  - the parameter 'train' is true because it is used for training here.

Training of models:
In this section the training of models is performed:
- training of models,
- save models.

Prediction:
In this section the prediction is performed:
- creating of the features for prediction from blind file provided,
- performing of prediction from fetaures,
- save the prediction in csv file,
