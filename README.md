# Welcome to Vannoli Marco github 
The repository is dedicated to machine learning, in particulary to the multi-class classificafier about provenance of compiler on assembly language (cyber security). Inside it, you will find the code implemented and results about testings.
# Report about it
The report producted by my self you can find inside the repository. Enjoy!
# Info about me
I am a student at the faculty of Artificial Inteligent and robotics of Sapienza (Rome). I am originally from Subiaco (RM) and I am passionate about the world of robotics and artificial intelligence, I am always active and enthusiastic when there is a new project to do, like this one!

## information
In order to run the code, you need the training and testing (blind) dataset
