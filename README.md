## skeleton
- code       #all code 
  |_ pathconfig.py #file py to manage all paths
  |_ evaluation_metrics.py #code for metrics methods
  |_ preprocessing.py #code which contains class needs to preprocessing
  |_ model.py #file py which was used to instance the different kind of mdoel based on different kind of algorithms
  |_ main.py #the main file to run ( P.S, it needs the paths of dataset (training and testing)!!!)
- resources # mappings are in here. you should place any additional resource (e.g. trained models) in here
  |__ 1860363.csv.tsv  # the csv file where teh rpedictions have been saved 
  |__ model_binary.model #the model, for binary classification task
  |__ model_binary.model #the model, for multi-class classification task

 #information
 In order to run the code, you need the training and testing (blind) dataset
